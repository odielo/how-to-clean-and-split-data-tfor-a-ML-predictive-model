How to Clean and Split Data for a Machine Learning Predictive Model
This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive guide on how to clean and split data for a Machine Learning predictive model.

Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and marketing. A significant part of building a machine learning predictive model involves cleaning and splitting the data. This process is crucial to ensure that the model is trained on accurate and reliable data.

The project is structured into two parts:

Cleaning the data
Splitting the data
Cleaning the Data
The cleaning process involves preparing the data by removing any noise, inconsistencies, and errors that may interfere with the model's accuracy. Some of the cleaning techniques that will be covered in this project include:

Handling missing data
Handling outliers
Handling duplicate data
Handling inconsistent data
Splitting the Data
After cleaning the data, the next step is to split it into training, validation, and test datasets. Splitting the data is important because it helps to evaluate the model's accuracy on new and unseen data. The project will cover the following techniques for splitting data:

Random splitting
Stratified splitting
Time-series splitting
Project Organization
The project is organized into the following directories:

data: contains the raw data files
notebooks: contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and splitting
scripts: contains Python scripts for data cleaning and splitting
tests: contains test files for validating the data cleaning and splitting scripts
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to view the data cleaning and splitting process.
Conclusion
Cleaning and splitting data are critical steps in building a reliable and accurate machine learning predictive model. This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to clean and split data for machine learning predictive models. Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or issues.
